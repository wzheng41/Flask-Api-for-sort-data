Backend Assessment - Blog Posts
Author:Wenzhe Zheng
In this assessment, you will write a simple backend JSON API. If you notice something
is not working (like the API, or any of the links in this document), please contact
hello@hatchways.io.
This assessment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
● Correctness: Is your solution complete and does it pass different test cases?
● Code Organization, Readability, & Maintainability: Is your code easy to read and
well organized?
● Code Performance: Is your code efficient? Did you use appropriate data
structures?
● Best Practices: Did you utilize good programming practices (write unit tests,
avoid anti-patterns)? Did you show a good grasp of your language/framework of
choice?
● Completion speed: A fast completion time comparable to the completeness of
your solution. This is the least important criteria.
We use the following rubric to evaluate your submission. Please note that if your
submission does not attempt to complete all of the requirements, we will be unable to
provide feedback on it.
Resources
If you are not familiar with how to set up a basic API, we recommend the following
resources:
● Python - Flask (Flask JSON API)
● Javascript - Node + Express
● Java - Spring Boot (JSON API)
● Ruby - Rails JSON API
You may use Javascript (Node.js), Python, Ruby, Java, Go, or Rust to complete this
assessment. You may use any framework for your language of choice. Please
document in a Readme how to start the application.
Data Source
You will be building an API that requires you to fetch data from this API:
Request:
Route: https://api.hatchways.io/assessment/blog/posts
Method: GET
Query Parameters:
Field Type Description
tag String (required) The tag associated with
the blog post.
Notice that the parameter is a query parameter - you can read more about query
parameters here. An example of sending the tag parameter is
https://api.hatchways.io/assessment/blog/posts?tag=tech.
Our API can only filter one tag at a time - notice that the field “tag” is singular and not
plural.
It will return a JSON object with an array of blog posts. An example response is:
{
"posts": [{
"id": 1,
"author": "Rylee Paul",
"authorId": 9,
"likes": 960,
"popularity": 0.13,
"reads": 50361,
"tags": [ "tech", "health" ]
},
...
]
}
API Requirements
You need the following routes in your API:
Route 1:
Request:
Route: /api/ping
Method: GET
Response:
Response body (JSON):
{
"success": true
}
Response status code: 200
Route 2:
Request:
Route: /api/posts
Method: GET
Query Parameters:
Field Type Description Default Example
tags String
(required)
A comma separated
list of tags.
N/A science,tech
sortBy String
(optional)
The field to sort the
posts by. The
acceptable fields are:
● id
● reads
● likes
● popularity
id popularity
direction String
(optional)
The direction for
sorting. The
acceptable fields are:
● desc
● asc
asc asc
Successful Response:
The API response will be a list of all the blog posts that have at least one tag
specified in the tags parameter.
The sortBy parameter specifies which field should be used to sort the returned
results. This is an optional parameter, with a default value of `id`.
The direction parameter specifies if the results should be returned in ascending
order (if the value is "asc") or descending order (if the value is "desc"). The default
value of the direction parameter is `asc`.
Here is how the response should look:
Response body (JSON):
{
"posts": [{
"id": 1,
"author": "Rylee Paul",
"authorId": 9,
"likes": 960,
"popularity": 0.13,
"reads": 50361,
"tags": [ "tech", "health" ]
},
...
]
}
Response status code: 200
Error Responses:
If `tags` parameter is not present:
Response body (JSON):
{
"error": "Tags parameter is required"
}
Response status code: 400
If a `sortBy` or `direction` are invalid values, specify an error like below:
Response body (JSON):
{
"error": "sortBy parameter is invalid"
}
Response status code: 400
Here is what you will need to do to complete this task:
● For every tag specified in the tags parameter, fetch the posts with that tag using
the Hatchways API (make a separate API request for every tag specified)
● Combine all the results from the API requests above and remove all the repeated
posts (try to be efficient when doing this)
● You will get a better score on our assessment if you can make concurrent
requests to the API (making the requests in parallel) (we understand that this job
is easier in some languages vs. others)
We have provided an API with the correct solution. This should only be used to verify
your results. Do not call this API in your application. Here it is in action:
https://api.hatchways.io/assessment/solution/posts?tags=history,tech&sortBy=likes&di
rection=desc
Step 3
An important part of development is testing. In this step, we want to see tests written
for your routes. Do not use the solutions API route to perform testing in this step. Think
about the different ways to test the app, and the best way to get good coverage.
Step 4 (Bonus!)
Making API calls to other servers can be expensive. How can you reduce the number of
calls you make to a server? You can cache the results of an API call on your server. Try
to implement a server side cache to our API. Two tips are 1) keep it simple, and 2) feel
free to use existing libraries/frameworks. Be sure to test your code after implementing
this to be sure it still works as expected.
Checklist
Before submitting your assessment, make sure you have:
❏ An /api/posts route that handles the following query parameters:
❏ tags (mandatory) : any number of comma-separated strings
❏ sortBy (optional) : one of “id”, “reads”, “likes”, “popularity”
❏ direction (optional) : one of “asc”, “desc”, defaults to “asc”
❏ Error handling: Return an error message if:
❏ tags parameter is missing
❏ sortBy or direction has an invalid value
❏ Testing without using our solution API route
❏ Caching (bonus)
Submission Details
Please submit your code in a compressed folder on the Hatchways platform. The max
submission size is 5MB.
Upon clicking the submission button, you will see a form as pictured below. We need
this information to be able to test your application.
1. Choose which language and additional technologies you used to develop your
solution. Be sure to select the appropriate version for the language you have
used.
2. Provide us with the install command, the run command, and the port that you
used to run your application.
3. If you cannot find your commands in our suggestions, simply type your own and
select “Use command”.
Please note that these commands will be used to run automated tests, so filling in every
relevant field and providing accurate commands will allow you to receive feedback more
quickly on your submission. If you have any notes to provide about your submission,
please put them in a README, not in the submission form. Additionally, note that the
install and run commands will be run from the root level of your submission, so please
organize your files accordingly.
Do not submit any built folders, since the compressed folder will be too large. Do not
submit your external dependencies (like the node_modules folder), since the
compressed folder will be too large. We will be installing your dependencies before we
run your code.
If your submission is too big and you can't figure out how to compress, you are welcome
to email your solution to hello@hatchways.io. Please include your name, and use the
email you signed up with on the Hatchways platform. Use the subject line “Back-end
Assessment Submission”.
Public Repositories
Do not post your solution to a public repository. We understand that you may want to
share projects you have worked on, but many hours go into developing our tools so we
can provide a fair skills evaluation.
